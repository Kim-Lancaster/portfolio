        <Paragraph text="I am an art major turned software developer. A few years ago someone suggested I learn to code for fun. At the time is sounded like a completely impossible fantasy. Fast forward to now, I am in love with programming. In fact, I spend most of my free time in front of the computer learning new languages and creating my own apps, websites and games. While my experience lies with front end development I won't stop there. I'll keep working and learning until I become a full stack godâ€¦ then, I might take a vacation." />
