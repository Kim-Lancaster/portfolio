Fast forward to now, I am in love with programming. In fact, I spend most of my free time in front of the computer learning new languages and creating my own apps, websites and games. While my experience lies with front end development I won't stop there. I'll keep working and learning until I become a full stack godâ€¦ then, I might take a vacation." />
